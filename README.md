shrimpie is a friday night funkin dandys world mod, multiple people were doing a protect the shrimpo run (a run where you protect shrimpo), everyone dies at above floor 10 and shrimpo is the only one left, having to deal with 3 twisteds at once. will he survive? (spoiler alert: no. he literally has the worst stats in the game)
